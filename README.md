# Pong in SFML 2.3.2
This is a basic pong game made using C++ and SFML 2.3.2. I made this to improve my object-orientated programming skills using C++ and SFML 2.3.2. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks.

## Installation
The straightforward method would be to use Visual Studio 2015 

1. Download ZIP and Extract Files
2. Open Solution File
3. [Configure Visual Studio Environment to run SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php)
4. Make sure to set build solution for 32-bit
