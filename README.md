# Pong in SFML 2.3.2
This is a basic pong game made using C++ and SFML 2.3.2. This is my first game which was made to improve my skills in C++ and SFML. Any feedback would be appreciated.

## Compiling
The best method would be to use Visual Studio 2015 

1. Download the ZIP file and extract the files
2. Open solution file (.sln)
3. [Configure Visual Studio Environment to run SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php)
4. Make sure to build solution for 32-bit
